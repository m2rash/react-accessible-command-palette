/**
 * Every user-facing string of the palette. Pass a partial object as the `labels`
 * prop; it is shallow-merged over these defaults.
 *
 * Anything depending on a value or a count is a function, so plural rules stay with
 * the caller and `t()` from i18next or react-intl can be called inside.
 *
 * Pass a stable object (module constant or `useMemo`) — a fresh one per render
 * invalidates the memoisation downstream.
 *
 * Not included: `shortcutAria` produces `"Control+N"` for `aria-keyshortcuts`. Those
 * are specification tokens, not display text.
